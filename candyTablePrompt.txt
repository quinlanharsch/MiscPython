Five children went trick-or-treating together and decided to randomly split their candy haul at the end of the night.
As it turned out, they got a total of 25 pieces of candy, 5 copies each of 5 different types (they live in a small town).
They distribute the candies by choosing an ordering of the 25 uniformly at random from all shufflings,
and then giving the first 5 to the first child, the second 5 to the second, and so on.

What is the probability that each child has one type of candy that they have strictly more of than every other trick-or-treater?
Give your (exact!) answer in a lowest terms fraction.
